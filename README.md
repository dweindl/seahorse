# Overview

This is an unofficial Python package for handling data from [Agilent Seahorse XF Analyzers](https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/real-time-cell-metabolic-analysis/xf-analyzers) (spreadsheets exported from *Wave*).

**This is alpha software. It is not yet well tested and has an unstable API. Use at your own risk.**

## Installation

```bash
pip install . # or `pip install -e .` for development installation
```

The `seahorse` package on PyPI is **not** this package.
